# Bootstrap-Table-with-Different-Row-Colors
This code showcases a Bootstrap table with distinct row colors for enhanced visual appeal. Each row in the table has a different background color, defined by Bootstrap's contextual classes (table-warning, table-primary, and table-success). The table includes columns for Prenom (First Name), "Nom" (Last Name), and Age, with sample data in the rows.
